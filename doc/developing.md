# Developing

This project is a Ruby on Rails project.

## Prerequisites

- rbenv - (https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) (optional, but recommended)
- ruby-build - (https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) (optional, but recommended)
- rbenv-vars - (https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv-vars) (optional, but recommended)
- ruby 2.2 or later
- bundler - (http://bundler.io/)
- libsodium
- postgresql

## Installing Prerequisites on OS X

### Installing Homebrew

The following instructions assume that you are using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), a package manager for OS X.  To install homebrew, please visit http://brew.sh/ and follow the instructions.

### Installing rbenv, ruby-build, and rbenv-vars

While optional, it's highly recommended you use some sort of ruby version manager to install jruby and ruby. My personal preference is [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), but [rvm](https://rvm.io) will work as well.

```bash
brew install rbenv
brew install ruby-build
brew install rbenv-vars
```

Some additional instructions for how to activate each of these will be printed by homebrew after each step, if necessary.  please follow them to activate rbenv for your shell

###  Installing Ruby 2.2

Now that we have rbenv and ruby-build installed, we can use them to get our ruby interpeter installed:

```bash
rbenv install 2.2.0
```

You can confirm they were installed successfully using:

```bash
âžœ RBENV_VERSION=2.2.0 ruby -v
ruby 2.2.0p0 (2014-12-25 revision 49005) [x86_64-darwin14]
```

### Installing bundler

```bash
RBENV_VERSION=2.2.0 gem install bundler
rbenv rehash
```

### Installing libsodium

```bash
brew install libsodium
```

### Installing postgresql

There are several ways to install postgres, please [see the downloads page for more details](http://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/).  Let's assume homebrew:

```bash
brew install postgresql
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
```

## Setting up Horizon

Whew! That's was quite a process.  Now let's go about setting up horizon and running our test suite.

Run the setup script to install dependencies, set up your local databases, and run the tests:

```
$ bin/setup
```

Let's take a closer look at what's going on under the hood in `bin/setup`:

### Installing rubygem dependencies

The first step to setting up a rails application locally is to install its rubygem dependencies.  To do this, we will use bundler, which we installed earlier:

```bash
bundle install
```

If all was successful, you should see something to the tune of:

```bash
Bundle complete! 40 Gemfile dependencies, 101 gems now installed.
Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
```

NOTE: You'll be running bundle install often.  It's good practice to run it everytime you pull code from github.

### Creating databases

We installed postgres earlier, and now we need to create the databases on the server to house our data.

```bash
rake db:create && RAILS_ENV=test rake db:create
psql -c 'create database "hayashi_test";' -U postgres
```

If you see a message such as `horizon_development already exists` in the output, that's alright.  Most likely, you'll simply see no output, indicating success.

### Running migrations to populate database schema

Now we have our databases, lets build our tables in those databases.

```bash
rake db:migrate && RAILS_ENV=test rake db:migrate
```

This command runs "migration files", a series of step by step instructions that will setup the schema correctly.  You can [read more about migrations here](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html). Long story short, you should run migrations using `rake db:migrate` everytime you update your local copy of the code from github.

If successful, you should see output that looks like this (but longer):

```bash
== 20150216185929 CreatePendingTransactions: migrating ========================
-- create_table(:pending_transactions)
   -> 0.3000s
== 20150216185929 CreatePendingTransactions: migrated (0.3000s) ===============

== 20150306215845 AddSequenceSlotToPendingTransaction: migrating ==============
-- change_table(:pending_transactions)
   -> 0.0200s
== 20150306215845 AddSequenceSlotToPendingTransaction: migrated (0.0200s) =====

...
```
### Pulling up an interactive console

We should now be able to launch an interactive rails console, into which we can type ruby code to inspect the running system:

```bash
rails console
```

If all goes well, you'll be at a ruby prompt that probably looks like:

```bash
Loading development environment (Rails 4.1.9)
[1] pry(main)>
```

We can test our connection to the database using by typing `History::Transaction.count` into the console and pressing enter.  you should see the a result similar to:

```bash
[1] pry(main)> History::Transaction.count
   (18.0ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "history_transactions"
=> 0
[2] pry(main)>
```

You can exit the console by typing `exit` at the prompt and pressing enter.

### Running the test suite

Now that we have confirmed we have can run a development console, we should be able to run the test suite.  To run it, enter:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

You should see output that eventually looks like:

```bash
Finished in 6.34 seconds (files took 12.39 seconds to load)
74 examples, 0 failures, 15 pending

Randomized with seed 27966
```

Tada! You are now setup.
